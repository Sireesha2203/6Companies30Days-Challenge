# 6Companies30Days-Challenge
Welcome to my 2025 challenge of solving DSA problems! This initiative is inspired by the Arsh DSA sheet, which contains a curated set of important problems to enhance problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. My goal is to solve all the problems within ~30 days by maintaining a steady pace of solving 15 questions every 5 days.
